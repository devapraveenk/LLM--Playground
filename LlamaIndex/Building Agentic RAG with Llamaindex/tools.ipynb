I. INTRODUCTION In today’s data-driven world, businesses are inundated with vast amounts of data that hold the potential to unlock significant insights. However, the manual process of analyzing this data is often time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. As companies strive to remain competitive, the need for an automated, reliable, and intelligent data analytics system has never been more critical.  Traditional data analysis methods often require extensive human  intervention, from data cleaning and preprocessing to complex statistical analysis and visualization. These steps, while essential, can lead to inconsistencies and delays, impeding timely decision-making. The limitations of manual processes underscore the necessity for a more streamlined, automated solution that can handle large datasets with precision and speed.  Our project addresses these challenges by developing an advanced automated data analytics pipeline. This system is designed to seamlessly connect to client databases, fetch relevant data, and perform comprehensive preprocessing tasks, including cleaning, imputation, and ensuring correct data types. By automating these foundational steps, the system significantly reduces the potential for human error and accelerates the overall analysis process.  Beyond preprocessing, the system also generates detailed abstracts of the data, encompassing metadata, feature descriptions, and statistical summaries. These abstracts include rigorous statistical tests to identify normal distributions, outliers, and influential points. By providing this level of detail, the system ensures that decision-makers have access to a complete and accurate picture of the data at their disposal.  One of the standout features of our project is the integration of generative AI techniques, specifically retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and few-shot prompting. These technologies enable the system to convert abstracted data files into embeddings, which are then indexed in a vector database. This allows for efficient, similarity-based content retrieval, facilitating more insightful and actionable analysis.  In addition to its analytical capabilities, the system incorporates a question-answering chatbox that interacts with decision-makers, helping to clarify requirements and refine analysis outputs. This interactive component ensures that the analysis is not only thorough but also aligned with the specific needs and goals of the business, enhancing its relevance and utility.  By automating and enhancing the data analysis process, our project empowers decision-makers with faster, more accurate, and more comprehensive insights. This not only accelerates strategic planning and implementation but also sets a new standard for how businesses leverage data in a rapidly evolving and competitive global marketplace.Related Works  II.
